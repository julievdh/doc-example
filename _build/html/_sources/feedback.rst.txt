========

Day 1
------

Intro to version control, Social Coding, Open Data

- Really useful and important background, foundation of the course
- Good background even to difference between git and github, git vs "open data" as many think these are synonymous
- Time management can be challenging but I appreciate the time given to specific questions, follow-up, etc. 
- Tutorials were good in that they reminded us of code/lessons we'd previously learned, re-emphasized tricks, etc. 
- Good progression of lessons/code-alongs (time for us to implement, then listen, then implement, then listen)

Day 2
------

Automated testing

- Something I'd never implemented that I see being extremely useful
- Excellent practice and aspect to introduce my research group to
- Tutorial allowed us to implement things we'd learned the previous day
- Great introduction to Travis, and implementation. Interesting social platform to show that we use testing, etc. 

Archaeology with git

- Also extremely useful, as this is something many of us face. 
- Tutorial could have used more show, then let us do it, then show more, then let us do it, to keep everyone following along. 
- grep-ing grep.c was confusing - consider using a different file to grep as an example. 

Day 3
-------

Reproducible research

- Great practices to implement (e.g. file tree example, makefiles/snakemake)
- Principles were relevant and tool to implement them was clear
- Good check with audience for whether or not certain things needed to be discussed (e.g. 'is reproducibility important' or the degree to which we used containers)

Documentation

- I liked the different methods shown to do this, the exposure to the different platforms etc. 
- Some of the lessons were too demo and then implement after (more code-along with many short breaks might be good in the future)
- Really important skills to be able to produce documentation on in these different formats, with different levels of distribution, etc. 

Jupyter Lab

- Good to get acquainted with it -- I'd heard a lot and had tried to implement it, but unsuccessfully. 
- If anything, learned that it's not all I expected it to be and that other aspects are more important to me (version control, documentation, distribution, workflows)

Modular coding

- Was shorter than planned. Good discussion and important messages. 



Overall
- Budget a bit more time in for wrap-up, discussion, questions
- Keep the model of short pauses in code-along for attendees to implement
- Day on/day off model, or morning on/afternoon off model
- I hope this can continue to grow around the Nordics - really valuable, and something I hope others attend in the future. I'll spread the word! 
- Trying to implement the things I learned right away, and remember which ones are important as I open new projects, etc. 

Thanks!!!
