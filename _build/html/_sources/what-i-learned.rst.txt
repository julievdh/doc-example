What I learned
===============

For next/new projects
----------------------

1. Directory structure idea to work towards (link)
2. Do automated testing for small things (units, etc) or big things. Matlab [maybe outdated] here.
3. Related, Travis for auto-test and to display test to community
4. README all the time


For existing projects
----------------------
- branch from master to test/add new things, then merge
- git graph 



When interacting on GitHub
---------------------------
- fork/config - branch - pull request 
- "fixes #N" to address issue in pull request


In general
----------
- so much more familiarity with terminal
- wrote first shell commands
- wrote first python scripts
- realized that jupyter notebooks aren't all I thought they would be [I think this is a good thing -- version control > notebook]
- fixed my website!
- made a website!
- used nano for the first time (and got in the swing of things)
