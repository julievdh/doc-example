What I learned
===============

For next/new projects
----------------------

1. `Directory structure idea <https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/02-organizing-projects/>`_ to work towards
2. Do automated testing for small things (units, etc) or big things. Matlab [maybe outdated] `link here <https://blogs.mathworks.com/images/steve/2010/Automated%20Software%20Testing%20for%20MATLAB%20(2009).pdf>`_
3. Related, `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/julievdh/cr-autotest/builds/466991778>`_ for auto-test and to display test to community
4. snakemake 



For existing projects
----------------------
- branch from master to test/add new things, then merge
- git graph 
- README!! 


When interacting on GitHub
---------------------------
- fork/config - branch - pull request 
- "fixes #N" to address issue in pull request


In general
----------
- so much more familiarity with terminal
- wrote first shell commands
- wrote first python scripts
- realized that jupyter notebooks aren't all I thought they would be [I think this is a good thing -- version control > notebook]
- fixed my website!
- made a website!
- used nano for the first time (and got in the swing of things)

Useful commands
----------------
- touch
